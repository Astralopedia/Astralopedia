# Create: Astral Energy Progression

_This guide was written by KonSola5 in official wiki_

## Energy Progression

### Chapter 3:

Alternators: Produce 15 E/t using 8192 su Wind Mills: Produce 5 E/t just because
they are above Y = 64, easily spammable

### Chapter 4:

Ultimate Solar Panels: Produce up to 48 E/t at day and 8 E/t at night, expensive
but maybe worth it? Coal Generators: Produce 20 E/t using Coal/Charcoal

### Chapter 5:

Fusion Reactor: Produce 16384 E/t x multiplier out of Deuterium and Tritium, get
it ASAP
